# drakepkg

The goal of `drakepkg` is to demonstrate how a [`drake`](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/) workflow can be organized as an R package.

This package is a work-in-progress that began with a request for guidance: [`drake` issue #471](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/471)

## Installation

You can install the released version of `drakepkg` from its Github [repository](https://github.com/tiernanmartin/drakepkg) with:

``` r
devtools::install_packages("tiernanmartin/drakepkg")
```
